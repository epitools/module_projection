%CREATEPROJECTION Discover the surface of the highest intensity signal in the image
%                 stack and selectively project the signal lying on that surface
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% PREAMBLE
%
% Creates a 2D projection from a Z-stack by selectively choosing from which
% plane to extract each pixel based on a surface estimation. The input image is
% composed of several z planes representing a cohesive tissue which can be
% approximated by a 3D surface. In order to exclude another surface from being
% also projected the latter has to have a lower intensity or at least a smaller
% number of high intensity points than the region of interest (ROI).
%
% INPUT [reccomended range]
%   1. ImStack - 3D image matrix in 8 or 16-bit greyscale
%   2. SmoothingRadius - gaussian blur to apply before estimating the surface [0.1 - 5]
%   3. depthThreshold - Cutoff distance in z-planes from the 1st estimated surface [1 - 3]
%   4. SurfSmoothness1 - Surface smoothness for 1st gridFit(c) estimation, the smaller the smoother [30 - 100]
%   5. SurfSmoothness1 - Surface smoothness for 3nd gridFit(c) estimation, the smaller the smoother [20 - 50]
%   6. ShowProcess - Boolean to output intermediate results
%
% OUTPUT
%   1. ProjIm - Projection of ImStack using only pixels closest to the 2nd gridfit surface
%   2. DepthMap - Z-location of pixels chosen for the Projected image from ImStack
%   3. xg2 - 1st component of the 2nd estimated gridfit surface
%   4. yg2 - 2nd component of the 2nd estimated gridfit surface
%   5. zg2 - 3rd component of the 2nd estimated gridfit surface
